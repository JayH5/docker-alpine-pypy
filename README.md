# docker-alpine-pypy

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/JayH5/docker-alpine-pypy/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/JayH5/docker-alpine-pypy)

> **Note:** As of PyPy 5.9.0, these images are based on Alpine Linux 3.6, rather than 3.4.

Docker images for [PyPy](http://pypy.org) running on [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org).

PyPy for Alpine Linux is built from [this](https://github.com/JayH5/alpine-pypy) repository. These are the associated Docker images that use that PyPy build.

These images seek to mimic the [official PyPy Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/pypy/) but are based on Alpine Linux instead of Debian for a smaller image size.

Built images are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamiehewland/alpine-pypy/).
